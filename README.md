# Computational Cognitive Neuroscience 
5 cr, University of Helsinki, spring 2021

Lecturer: Aapo Hyvärinen TA: Hermanni Hälvä

This webpage contains the coursework. See the sub-folders for each week's work, with submission information inside.
You obviosuly need to complete the questions locally on your computer. In case you haven't used git before, you clone the repo
by "git clone https://github.com/HHalva/ccn.git" on your command line. 

In order to complete these courseworks, you will need:
  - Git
  - python 3 (I recommend setting everything up via [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html))
  - [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) (you need this on your computer to open the assignments)
  - numpy package
  - [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) package
  
In case you have any questions, please open an issue in the tab above, or email myself or Aapo. Opening an issue is preferable as then every one can benefit from your question. Also if you find any mistakes (very likely) please let us know!

Useful extra resources (week 1):
  - Goodfellow's [deep learning book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
  - Michael Nielsen's neural network book [pdf](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)
  - Karpathy's programming oriented guide with some useful coding examples (http://karpathy.github.io/neuralnets/)
  - For all things matrix including derivations, the world famous matrix [cookbook](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/matrixcookbook.pdf)
