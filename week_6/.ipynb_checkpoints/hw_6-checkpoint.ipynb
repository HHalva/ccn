    "Create a function that implements complex cell responses as per equation (12.1) and does so for 432 different configurations as explained on page 275 i.e. all filters are 6x6, there is one centered at each pixel location (36), with 4 different possible orientations, and 3 different frequencies, thus $3\\times4\\times36$ combinations. You can choose the parameters yourself, but make them reasonable. Illustrate your code by calculating this 432 long output on a series of image patches (use above code and data from previous weeks to load patches). Here you can assume that each image patch is the same size as your gabor filter so that we dont need to worry about convolving over the patch; to reiterate, each image patch should give out a 432 long vector.\n",

Each of the 10 elements of $p(\\mathbf{s}_i)$ follow, independently, laplace distribution as defined [here](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.laplace.html) with the location and scale parameters varying between the elements. \n",
